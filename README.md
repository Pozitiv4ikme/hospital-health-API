# hospital-health-API
Create an API that allows you to receive and transmit data on the health of light-sick patients in the hospital, which are taken from trackers (pressure, temperature, heart rate). It should be noted that patients are in the wards and buildings of the hospital, and are not displayed in a large tabular list.
